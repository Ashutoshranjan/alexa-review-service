Nope. Anything remotely technical requires you to use this app. And this app is painful to use. It starts off tyrying to push echo dot conversations on me. It's got 3 buttons that all seem to do the same thing (start conversations with people over echos). If you tell alexa to conncet to bluetooth she tells you to use this app (why? Its the 21st century! Why cant you just find and pair without me having to manually do it in an app), but she then says to install the skill in smart home. Smart home, list devices.. Cant find bluetooth speakers. Ok, skills, i guess i have to install a stupid skill for bluetooth. The skills section of the app is a hot mess. The search funtion flatout DOES NOT WORK. On top of that, apparently we're still in the dark ages of smart devices because every vendor under the sun has their own stupid skills app they want you to install on alexa. This s reams of no standadizations yet. Alexa shouldnt need to learn \"skills\" to connect to smart devices. She has to simply because smart device manufacturers havent standardized things yet. Everyone of them wants to be primma donna with their own skill app, so in addition to painfully digging for it, you have to pray the vendor actually put time into making it work (theres a reason they have star ratings on the skills...ugh). Anyways, i have to google up how to pair alexa to bluetooth speakers (that very necessity means alexa is failing at her GD job, bc she tells me to go to this stupid app instead of doing it directly, and this app is a hot mess to use). There is a bluetooth section. But the app can only seem to find ONE device at a time. Your device didnt show up? Hit back and try again, like you're at a roullette table hoping your number comes up. Ugh! Finally my speakers show up, and the app sits there trying to connect. My phone takes like 2 seconds to connect to them when I do it through settings. But alexa (echo dot) takes forever. Why?! Then you exit, try again, but she lists them as a decice she knows BUT IS NOT PAIRED TO. PAIR TO THE GD SPEAKERS FFS! You click on them in the list, app cooks then finally pairs. Does alexa say anything to automatcally confirm she's using the speakers? No. So you have to ask her something stupid to get her to speak and see if shes using the speakers. This way more painful then it should be. You can make a list using her, but to delete it \"use the app\". Why? DELETE THE GD LIST WHEN I TELL YOU! And lists are useless. I make a list of songs. Tell alexa to play the songs in the list. Nope. She can't do that. I make a list of numbers. Give me the sum total of those numbers. Nope. They need to add WAY more functionality to lists if they're going to be of any use. They're basically one dimensional string arrays you cant do anything with. So close yet so far. Next we have the tplink smart plug amazon suggested we buy when we got the echo dot. Well we have a living room lamp thats a pita to turn on and off so it'd be great to just tell alexa to do that. Try to get that thing going is a pita in and of itself (plug in, install ANOTHER app, hook to it, hook to network, create yet another login, etc). Finally get it going as a smart plug. Now we have to pair it with alexa. Open skills, install more crap, look for device IN THE APP bc alexa is too stupid to pair using just voice, finally get them paired. \"Alexa turn on the (light name)\". \"I'm sorry I can't find that device.\" YES YOU CAN! I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT IN YOUR APP! I CAN EVEN USE YOUR APP TO MANUALLY TURN IT ON AND OFF! WHY CAN'T YOU VOICE COMMAND IT?! This was one of the reasons we got the echo dor and it CAN'T DO IT'S GD JOB! They need to make alexa be able to do more of this maintenance crap through her instead of this stupid app. They need to standardize smart devices and get rid of skills. But if they force you to install skills, FIX THE GD SEARCH. This app is painful and makes me want to get rid of alexa.","PreliminaryHerring","iTunes",2,"Painful","Amazon Alexa","2017-12-10T18:41:21.000");

The one that I got was minimally conversant in English and had what sounded like an Indian accent- as did all the other people in the room. Her help consisted of reading a manual to me - covering things that had no relevance to my problem.   Not surprisingly, I received no help. \n\nI did, however, receive an email from Amazon with a request to complete a survey. I complied, explaining my problem and basically asking that they call me. Of course, they did not call. \n\nNow don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am an Amazon Prime member and am happy with their Prime program, including Prime Pantry.

Learning is important and doing this basic troubleshootings can save time. Trust me this is based in experience and I know that this is frustrating and disappointing but still technology is not dormant so we should never stop learning as well.

Now, as of July 28, control of Wemo devices has become erratic and semi-functional. I have updated Wemo device firmware, re-enabled the Wemo account connection, re-dscovered devices within the Alexa app, but it's still extremely retarded, with very long delays between the command and whatever execution it decides to implement (which varies from attempt to attempt.) I might blame Wemo, since it's a terrible app as well, but all devices are currently working fine from the Wemo app. My main motivation with Alexa/Echo was home automation control, but it's not reliable. Waking up to a noise, and saying \"Alexa; lights on\" should, you know, turn on the lights. But Alexa hesitates for a substantial period of time, then might (or might not) turn on a totally random selection of Wemo devices. Not ready for Prime time, pun intended. Alexa and my Echo devices are mostly just music streaming speakers now, and the only devices with a decent speaker for that purpose are the tall original Echos. Besides, with Amazon devices, unlike Google Home, you can't get the same stream coordinated on multiple devices concurrently. The Echo Show speakers are very directional (and the device is also hard of hearing.)

Just say a name of a song or artist and it will be played. I think most reviews are due to user error and not the device. Sure the app could use a little work but for the most part it works flawlessly. Easy to find skills and set alarms, add more devices and link my smart home devices. I don't know why people say it's hard to connect to WiFi because it is the easiest device I've ever hooked up to my wifi. Its never lost connection either. Only when the power has gone out but as soon as it's back on so is alexa. I have over 70 devices paired with the app and alexa has not once messed up when giving a command to lock a door or turn on a light.

I'm not a huge fan of my dot to begin with but the app just destroys any positive feelings I might have had.   One of the biggest things I use the app for is text to speech on my Kindle books. Not only can I not arrange how I want the icons to look or hide services I don't use, but I can't   search through my books for the title I want or sort them. It is also virtually impossible to just say \"Alexa read XXXXX\" because she has no idea what I'm talking about.  My roommate foumd the same thing when she tried to get the app to read to her. You have to dig through all the books to find the one you want and then hit play.   Also, Alexa is extremely  spotty with pronunciation (i.e., a character whose name is Manny sometimes gets called Man, sometimes pronounced Many and sometimes pronounced Manny; a character named Colin is sometimes prounced like Cawlin and sometimes like Colon).  All that being said, the biggest thing I hate about the app is that it randomly stops, as if a sleep timer went off and it stops reading. If I wake her up by saying \"Alexa\", she reads a few more words and then stops or she will randomly start reading again (i.e., a 3 am the book will come back on for a sentence or two and then will stop again). This would continue the whole book if I let it. Amazon says it's most likely the internet connection but I can tell you it absolutely is not.   I realize Alexa was a pioneer in AI in her early days, but one would think Amazon would have improved her since then.

I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \n\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \"now playing \" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \"snappy\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus.

Add to that the fact that ‚Äúrecent‚Äù music stations rarely work now. I have to go directly to the Tunein option and start music from there. And the downhill slide continues. \n\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \n\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \"now playing \" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \"snappy\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus.

What the hell are these developers doing? They are literally forcing people to google and Apple. In the good ole days before this app became too bloated for its on good, i could turn on my external Bluetooth speaker, ask my Alexa Dot to play music and it would automatically play through my external speaker. Those days are gone people!! LISTEN TO ME!!!! THEY ARE GONE!! NO MORE!!! Now I have to pair the dot and speaker each time I want to use the external speaker. It‚Äôs a multi-step time consuming process. These developers must be getting minimum wage as there is absolutely no incentive to get an app out there that works. They fix one thing and break another. I‚Äôm on the verge of going with Apple new home device, or even google for that matter. \n\nFeb 2018 review. My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! It took some figuring out but now, instead of turning on Alexa music, then my blue tooth shower radio and instantly hearing music, I have to go into settings, blue tooth, and manually connect my external speaker each time. Add to that the fact that ‚Äúrecent‚Äù music stations rarely work now. I have to go directly to the Tunein option and start music from there. And the downhill slide continues. \n\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \n\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \"now playing \" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \"snappy\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus.

Automatic Bluetooth connection to external speakers (Dot) is still a thing of the past. Now requires multi-step paring each time. The app is total garbage!\n\nContinued problems with external Bluetooth speaker for Dot. What the hell are these developers doing? They are literally forcing people to google and Apple. In the good ole days before this app became too bloated for its on good, i could turn on my external Bluetooth speaker, ask my Alexa Dot to play music and it would automatically play through my external speaker. Those days are gone people!! LISTEN TO ME!!!! THEY ARE GONE!! NO MORE!!! Now I have to pair the dot and speaker each time I want to use the external speaker. It‚Äôs a multi-step time consuming process. These developers must be getting minimum wage as there is absolutely no incentive to get an app out there that works. They fix one thing and break another. I‚Äôm on the verge of going with Apple new home device, or even google for that matter. \n\nFeb 2018 review. My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! It took some figuring out but now, instead of turning on Alexa music, then my blue tooth shower radio and instantly hearing music, I have to go into settings, blue tooth, and manually connect my external speaker each time. Add to that the fact that ‚Äúrecent‚Äù music stations rarely work now. I have to go directly to the Tunein option and start music from there. And the downhill slide continues. \n\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \n\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \"now playing \" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \"snappy\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus.
